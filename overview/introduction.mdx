# Welcome to Proxus

Industrial operations today are more connected than ever ‚Äî yet more fragmented. Data is trapped across PLCs, SCADA systems, MES tools, and siloed databases. Complex toolchains and vendor lock-in make integration costly and fragile.

**Proxus** is built to solve this. It‚Äôs a distributed, edge-first IIoT platform that brings together data acquisition, analytics, visualization, and IT/OT integration in one unified environment. Instead of relying on fragile central systems, Proxus processes and enriches data where it‚Äôs created ‚Äî at the edge.

With built-in support for the Unified Namespace (UNS) and Single Source of Truth (SSoT) principles, Proxus ensures that all operational data is consistent, accessible, and contextualized across teams and systems ‚Äî in real time.

Whether you're monitoring a CNC machine, managing a remote solar inverter, or synchronizing hundreds of devices across a plant network, Proxus offers the speed, clarity, and interoperability needed for modern industrial intelligence.

**Proxus** is a distributed Industrial IoT (IIoT) platform designed to simplify data acquisition, analysis, and integration across industrial operations. It centralizes multiple complex functions ‚Äî including collection, rule processing, edge computing, storage, visualization, and enterprise integration ‚Äî into a unified system.

Built with performance and flexibility in mind, Proxus helps organizations manage industrial data at scale while reducing the time, cost, and effort typically required by fragmented, traditional solutions.
