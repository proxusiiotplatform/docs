# Welcome to Proxus

Industrial operations today are more connected than ever ‚Äî yet more fragmented. Data is trapped across PLCs, SCADA systems, MES tools, and siloed databases. Complex toolchains and vendor lock-in make integration costly and fragile.

**Proxus** is built to solve this. It's a distributed, edge-first Industrial IoT platform that unifies data acquisition, analytics, visualization, and IT/OT integration in one comprehensive solution. Instead of relying on fragile central systems, Proxus processes and enriches data where it's created ‚Äî at the edge.

With built-in support for the Unified Namespace (UNS) and Single Source of Truth (SSoT) principles, Proxus ensures that all operational data is consistent, accessible, and contextualized across teams and systems ‚Äî in real time.

Whether you're monitoring a CNC machine, managing a remote solar inverter, or synchronizing hundreds of devices across a plant network, Proxus offers the speed, clarity, and interoperability needed for modern industrial intelligence.

## Why Choose Proxus?

Transform your industrial operations with a platform designed to eliminate complexity while maximizing performance and scalability.
