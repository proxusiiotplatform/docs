# Welcome to Proxus

**Proxus** is a next-generation Industrial IoT (IIoT) platform that unifies data collection, real-time analytics, rule-based processing, long-term storage, edge computing, and enterprise integration in a single high-performance system. Designed for the demands of modern industrial environments, Proxus empowers manufacturers, energy providers, utilities, and mining operators to transform raw operational data into actionable insights ‚Äî securely, reliably, and at scale.

## What is Proxus?

Proxus is a **comprehensive IIoT and UNS (Unified Namespace)** platform that bridges the gap between Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT). By combining real-time data ingestion, event-based processing, edge analytics, and cloud-native integrations, Proxus delivers a unified data infrastructure built for Industry 4.0.
