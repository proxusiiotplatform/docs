# Proxus Rules Engine

The Proxus Rules Engine is a powerful automation tool designed for IoT-based industrial systems that analyzes data from devices and performs automated actions based on predefined conditions.

## What is the Rules Engine?

The Rules Engine processes data streams from industrial devices in real-time, evaluates them against custom criteria, and triggers appropriate actions when conditions are met. This core component of the Proxus platform enables automated decision-making without manual intervention.

## Common Use Cases

The Rules Engine can be applied to numerous industrial scenarios:

### Automated Monitoring

Monitor equipment parameters in real-time and trigger alerts when values exceed safe thresholds. For example, alert maintenance teams when a motor's temperature rises above 80Â°C.

### Predictive Maintenance

Detect early warning signs of equipment failure by analyzing changes in performance metrics over time.

### Process Control

Automatically adjust process parameters based on incoming sensor data to maintain optimal operating conditions.

### Safety Systems

Create automated safety responses to dangerous conditions, such as emergency shutdowns when critical thresholds are breached.

### Quality Control

Monitor production parameters and flag products that may not meet quality standards based on process data.

## Architecture Overview

The Rules Engine operates within the Proxus platform architecture:

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors and industrial devices send data to Proxus
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The platform normalizes and prepares data
3. **Rule Evaluation**: The Rules Engine evaluates the criteria against incoming data
4. **Action Triggering**: When conditions are met, predefined actions are executed
5. **Logging & Feedback**: All activities are logged for audit and improvement

## Components of the Rules Engine

The Rules Engine consists of several key components:

### Data Structure

All data processed by the Rules Engine follows a standardized structure called `TransportData`, which includes:

- **Payload**: Real-time measurements from sensors and devices
- **MetaData**: Device information and identifiers
- **Topic**: Data source identifier
- **Attributes**: Additional contextual properties

### Criteria Language

The Rules Engine uses a powerful SQL-like criteria language to define conditions. This language supports:

- Various data types (numeric, string, boolean, datetime)
- Comparison operators (=, >, <, etc.)
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Pattern matching and range checks

### Actions

When conditions are met, the Rules Engine can trigger various actions:

- Send notifications (email, SMS, in-app alerts)
- Execute commands on devices
- Log events
- Trigger workflows
- Update dashboards
